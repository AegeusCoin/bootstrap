### A few details to cover

- If prompted to overwrite any existing files within the 'blocks' directory, choose yes.
- This file is hosted on the IPFS network.  If you already have IPFS installed, you can simply type: ipfs get QmajB3M2pSDNQdvmDsBV272MKcqn918g9YbcjqvwxrqFdD
- This update includes up to block 227942 and unlike a typical bootstrap, will be much quicker.
- The filename will be QmajB3M2pSDNQdvmDsBV272MKcqn918g9YbcjqvwxrqFdD but will decompress to a directory named 'blocks'.

3. Open your Aegeus wallet and the sync will then check with peers for the best height and begin syncing to catch up.

We will keep this file as updated as possible to minimize the amount of time that might take.
